# Mini Transfers Challenge (Solana + SUI)

Welcome üëã  
This is a take-home coding challenge where you‚Äôll build a simple frontend to transfer tokens on **Solana Devnet** and **SUI Testnet**, integrating with wallet providers.

---

## üéØ Goal

Create a minimal web app where a user can:

- Connect a **Solana** wallet (via Reown AppKit)
- Connect a **SUI** wallet (via Suiet Wallet Kit)
- Input recipient + amount and send a transfer on each chain
- View recent transactions in a table

You‚Äôll be working inside a Next.js + TypeScript repo with starter code for both chains.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Test Networks

- **Solana:** Devnet

  - Faucet: [https://solfaucet.com/](https://solfaucet.com/) or [https://faucet.solana.com/](https://faucet.solana.com/)
  - RPC (used by default): `https://api.devnet.solana.com`

- **SUI:** Testnet
  - Faucet: [https://faucet.sui.io/](https://faucet.sui.io/)
  - RPC (used by default): `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io`

---

## ‚úÖ Candidate Tasks

1. **Dependency Management**

   - Resolve any dependency issues and ensure the app runs with `pnpm run dev`.

2. **Solana Integration**

   - Wire up Reown AppKit to connect a Solana devnet wallet.
   - Use the provided `createSolanaTransfer` helper to send SOL on devnet.
   - Show the connected public key in the UI.

3. **SUI Integration**

   - Wire up Suiet Wallet Kit to connect a SUI testnet wallet.
   - Use the provided `createSuiTransfer` helper to send SUI on testnet.
   - Show the connected address in the UI.

4. **Responsive Design**

   - Fix the `TransferCard` component so it works on small screens (‚â§375px).
   - No horizontal scrolling, inputs should stack nicely.

5. **Transaction History**

   - Complete the provided hooks (`useSolanaTransactions`, `useSuiTransactions`) so the app can display transactions for the connected account.
   - Show them in the `TransactionTable` component.

6. **Bug Hunt**

   - One of the Solana/SUI transfer helpers has a subtle bug üêû. Identify and fix it.

7. **Documentation**

   - Add a short note in this README describing:
     - What changes you made
     - Any issues you ran into
     - How to run your solution

8. **Bonus Challenge**
   - Show off your design skills
     - Design a new homepage for the application
     - Make the transfer cards look nice

## üß∞ Working Process

My work process is like, make the things work, make the things right and only then... make the things faster.

So for this project I did:

**Make the things work**

- Fix/Update dependencies
- Implement ConnectWallet buttons to ensure connecting wallets
- createSolanaTransfer fix rpcUrl
- implement all useSolanaTransactions and ensure return right data to render on table.
- createSuiTransfer fix SUI mist, the SUI decimal was wrong, 1 SUI is 1.000.000.000 MIST not 1.000.000
- implement all useSuiTransactions and ensure return right data to render on table.

**Make the things right**

- Improve layout, make things responsive, like Transaction Card, Table and Header
- Use forms to manage data input. To manage the forms I used react-hook-form + zod to validation
- Use zod to validate data on the frontend as well as on the backend(server-actions)
- Refactor frontend, move all the business logic to the backend using server actions. The frontend only signs the transactions when needed.
- To create server actions I used zsa. With zsa we can make server action in a cool way ensuring strong typing through backend to frontend and another things.

**Make the things faster (TODO)**

- Engineering process to improve the backend and frontend
- Apply some architecture, like clean architecture etc.
- Apply Service Locator pattern to ensure better performance on serverless infrastructure, because its allow dependencies cache through requests
